        <h1>ABOUT E-DONATION</h1>
        <p> The process of donation collection has always been challenging. E-Donation system is an donation collecting system which meets the fundraising goal. Through this system, we aim to find the helpless, needy people and connect them with donors who are willing to contribute. As we can see that there is an alarming gap between the donors and the fundraisers. Inorder to bridge this gap, this system works as a platform to raise funds. This system allows any individual or a non-profit organization to add the details of the cause for donation. The donor who is willing to help can make donations. The verification of whether the cause is real or not is done which provides an assurance to the donor that their contribution is being received by the right hands. E-Donation system also has a recommendation feature which recommends the donor similar kind of causes if he/she might be further interested in donations.</p>
